My first Python style app will be a banking app. This is a typical app that's allows you to manage your banking app, this will include:

- `Signing/Login` 
- `Managing your account`
- `choosing different banking types`
- `Creating a digital card for your money`
- `Have contact friends to give money`
- `Ability to transfer to charity`


Current I have no style planned for my banking app. Maybe something with purple?

I have now gotten a Wireframe that will help me coordinate how I will display my program
I will talk more about it in the Layout and Code file:

A user may ask this question:

`Hello, I would like to have a test build on a banking app that will need the necessary components which will function the app. For example: I would like to input money from the bank into the card by using the app, having the ability to change my avatar settings, see my friends and send them money to them and charity.`

I will contains various programming styles to enhance the user experience such as using good list and variables for the data.
