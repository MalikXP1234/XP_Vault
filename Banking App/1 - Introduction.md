My first Python style app will be a banking app. This is a typical app that's allows you to manage your banking app, this will include:

- Signing/Login 
- Managing your account
- choosing different banking types
- Creating a digital card for your money
- Have contact friends to give money
- Ability to transfer to charity


Current I have no style planned for my banking app. Maybe something with purple?

I will contains various programming styles to enhance the user experience such as using good list and variables for the data.
