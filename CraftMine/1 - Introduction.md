This is a simple project that I have created around 2 years ago during my 6th form. I was tasked to create a NEA project that was 20% for my whole course. My main idea was based from my favorite game which was Minecraft. I also had to make a reason from creating this application which was making the game which was from Minecraft to be a simpler version of the main game. To do this, I had to do a extent of researching key aspects towards the game foundation including world generation, inventory, items and mobs. This all lead to me creating this application called Craft mine. 

Story of the game: There was a person who was playing their usual game until one day, he was isekai'd and teleported to the strange world of craft-mine. With is mere knowledge of the main game. He started to look around the area, collecting materials, and finding a boat that would allow him to escape the island.

Craft-Mine contain a lot of functionality from its parent game:

- Spawns user onto a pre-loaded map with picture boxes of things such as trees and rocks
- User was allowed to collide (interact) these pictures to get materials by doing a minigame
-
