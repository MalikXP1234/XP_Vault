This is a simple project that I have created around 2 years ago during my 6th form. I was tasked to create a NEA project that was 20% for my whole course. My main idea was based from my favorite game which was Minecraft. I also had to make a reason from creating this application which was making the game which was from Minecraft to be a simpler version of the main game. To do this, I had to do a extent of researching key aspects towards the game foundation including world generation, inventory, items and mobs. This all lead to me creating this application called Craft mine. 

**Story of the game: There was a person who was playing their usual game until one day, he was isekai'd and teleported to the strange world of craft-mine. With is mere knowledge of the main game. He started to look around the area, collecting materials, and finding a boat that would allow him to escape the island.**

This is what Craft-Mine will give you as a user:

- `Spawns user onto a pre-loaded map with picture boxes of things such as trees and rocks`
- `User is allowed to collide (interact) these pictures to get materials by doing a minigame`
- `User would be able to get materials which would go into the inventory to be used.`
- `Inventory contains materials, crafting system, level up section and a leaderboard.`
- `User would need to collect the materials needed to fix the ship and escape`

However this is the mere stuff to get some marks on the NEA project however I do have plans to update this game which would be quite needed in the long term.

- `Change the programming language from VB.Net to C# which would allow me to do better use of OOP (object oriented Programming)`
- `User is able to do more things such as fishing, mining in caves and fight mobs`
- `User has the ability to choose difficulty.`
- `Create different modes such as death mode or even a speed run`
- `Allow multiplayer`
